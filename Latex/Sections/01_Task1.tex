\section*{Cleaning data}

As we can see, some of the continous variables in the dataset has outliers. These outliers are loacted above the 99\% percentile, and below the 1\% perecntile.
To mitigate the influence of extreme values in the dataset, all continous variables are therefore winsorized at these perenctiles.

After checking for missing values, inconsitencies between private and public dummy values and negative values, i cant seem to find any mistakes in the data. 
The data fulfills the set of criterias defined in the assignment.
